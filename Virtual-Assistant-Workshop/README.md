# Files
- _Poster_ is the poster given via the email.
- The jupyter notebook contains most of the code done during the workshop.
- The python file contains a more concise and user-friendly way of running the virtual agent.
# Errors
- Some questions aren't matching properly, I don't know how to correct that.
  - This is caused by the lingualytics.preprocessing.remove_lessthan() function.
  - It isn't working how I want it to.
# How was it
It was a blatant promotion for 'kandi' which is an _okay_ site but took more than half the time of the session. That aside, it was good and I got to make a sort-of ML thing!!:)
